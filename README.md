# VitaMatch – Organ Donation Management System

VitaMatch is a full-stack web application designed to streamline and digitize the organ donation and allocation process between **donors**, **doctors**, and **hospitals**.

The platform enables donors to register and offer organs, doctors to request and allocate organs, and both parties to track donation status in real time.
